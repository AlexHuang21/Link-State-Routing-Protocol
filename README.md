# Link-State-Routing-Protocol
This repository features a Link-State Routing (LSR) protocol implementation. Each router broadcasts link-state information and computes least-cost paths using Dijkstra's algorithm. The project handles dynamic network conditions, including node failures and rejoining nodes, and uses multithreading for efficient communication.
